When you want to publish a new version of CrossGenerate with its documentation, make sure to:
1. Build the documentation with mkdocs_build.cmd.
2. Create a new folder in ftp://x-breeze.com/generate.x-breeze.com/docs/ for the version (or re-use the existing).
3. Upload the documentation into the version folder.
4. Update the version number in the latest/.htaccess file and upload it to ftp://x-breeze.com/generate.x-breeze.com/docs/latest/
