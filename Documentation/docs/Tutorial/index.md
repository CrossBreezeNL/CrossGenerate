# Tutorial

Generating historical stage using MS-SQL and CrossGenerate.


## Introduction

In this tutorial we will learn how to build a historical stage based on our source SQL-database. We will generate XML-model from our database in SQL Server. Then we’ll use our XML-model to generate Integration Service project and Database project. Then we will use those two projects to copy data from the source model to the staging and archive stages in our database.
