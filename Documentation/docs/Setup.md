# Setup CrossGenerate

## System requirements
CrossGenerate runs on Java, so install a Java version on your system. For example [OpenJava](https://jdk.java.net/)

## Installing CrossGenerate
1. Download the latest release from our [download page](http://downloadCrossGenerate). This release contains the executable jar for CrossGenerate.
2. It is advised to download one of the [template projects](http://xgentemplates) to quickly be up and running. These templates contain an example configuration that you can experiment with right away.
3. Change the cmd file(s) in the template project so they point to the location where you have extracted the CrossGenerate jar in step 1.
4. Run the cmd file and see if everything works. If all works out the Output folder of the template project should contain the newly generated files.

## PowerDesigner extension
To get the most out of CrossGenerate it should be used in combination with a data modeling tool. Currently SAP PowerDesigner is the tool best fit to model not only data structures but also data flows. If you are planning to use PowerDesigner with CrossGenerate, make sure to download our [PowerDesigner extension](http://downloadPDExtension) and read the [Modeling documentation](./modeling_with_the_PowerDesigner_extension).
