# Template

The template while generating is the file which contains the original source code which needs to be repeated based on information from the model.

A typical example of a template would be a DDL script to create a table for the staging database, or an ETL package to load data a source system to the staging database.

CrossGenerate supports two types of template, namely:

- [Text](./TextTemplate)
- [XML](./XmlTemplate)
